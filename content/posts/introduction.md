Welcome!

I'm a graphics programmer working in triple A games.

I'm starting this blog as I want to learn the Vulkan API (it's due time!). I thought that if I could document my learning process, day by day, it might help me fixate concepts in my mind as well as helping other people following the same journey!

Stay tuned for Day 1!
